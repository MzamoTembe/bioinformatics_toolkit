# Bioinformatics Toolkit
This repository contains alot of bioinformatics related scripts (with notebooks that typically explain each script in details).
The scripts will be very random as they are just a set of all the bioinformatics code that I do. So it could be anything
 from machine learning related content with proteins to basic genomics.
